# Changelog

## 0.2 — draft, 2026-09-15

- Add versioned evidence-sufficiency semantics: completed `NOT_ESTABLISHED`
  is distinct from untested properties and verifier failures.
- Require nonempty, pinned resolved evidence for new `PASS`/`FAIL` records;
  validate unique property IDs and canonical ID/name pairs.
- Clarify scoped E observation coverage and preserve observed bypass failures
  even when other evidence is incomplete.
- Add a bounded accepted-evidence reference rule, synthetic fixtures, negative
  schema checks and read-only harness integrity tests.
- Replace the incomplete README snippet with a schema-valid unassessed example.
- Preserve the v0.1 specification, schema and historical AEGIS assessment.

This is an independent draft update, not a CoSAI standard or certification.
